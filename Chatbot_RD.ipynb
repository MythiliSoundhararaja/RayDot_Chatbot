Plaque is the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other\\nsubstances. As plaque continues to build up in the arteries, blood\\nflow to the heart is reduced.\\nHeart disease can lead to a heart attack. A heart attack happens\\nwhen an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque, preventing\\nvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart. A heart attack\\ncan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.\\nHeart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases, which are\\ndisorders of the heart and blood vessel system. Other cardiovascular\\ndiseases include stroke, high blood pressure, and rheumatic heart\\ndisease.\\nSome people aren’t too concerned about heart disease because they\\nthink it can be “cured” with surgery. This is a myth.\\nHeart disease is a lifelong condition: Once you get it,\\nyou’ll always have it. It’s true that procedures such as\\nangioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and\\noxygen flow more easily to the heart. But the arter-\\nies remain damaged, which means you are still more\\nlikely to have a heart attack. What’s more, the\\ncondition of your blood vessels will steadily\\nworsen unless you make changes in your\\ndaily habits and control your risk factors.\\nMany people die of complications\\nfrom heart disease, or become \\npermanently disabled. That’s\\nwhy it is so vital to take action to \\nprevent this disease.\\n3What You Need To Know About Heart Disease\\nWhat You Need To Know\\nAbout Heart Disease\\n'),\n",

They can also increase the chances that an\\nexisting disease will get worse. Important risk factors for heart dis-\\nease that you can do something about are cigarette smoking, high\\nblood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical \\ninactivity, and diabetes. Recent research shows that more than \\n95 percent of those who die from heart disease have at least one \\nof these major risk factors.\\nCertain risk factors, such as getting older, can’t be changed. After\\nmenopause, women are more likely to develop heart disease. For\\nboth women and men, middle age is a time of increasing risk\\nbecause people are more likely to develop heart disease risk factors\\nduring this stage of life.\\nFamily history of early heart disease is another risk factor that can’t\\nbe changed. If your father or brother had a heart attack before age\\n55, or if your mother or sister had one before age 65, you are more\\nlikely to get heart disease.\\nWhile certain risk factors cannot be changed, it is important to \\nrealize that you do have control over many others. Regardless of\\nyour age or family history, you can take important steps to lower\\nyour risk of heart disease.\\nHow Risk Works\\nIt may be tempting to believe that doing just one healthy thing will\\ntake care of your heart disease risk. For example, you may hope\\nthat if you walk or swim regularly, you can still eat a lot of fatty\\nfoods and stay fairly healthy. Not true. To protect your heart, it is\\nvital to make changes that address each and every risk factor you\\nhave. You can make the changes gradually, one at a time. But mak-\\ning them is very important.\\nWhile each risk factor increases your risk of heart disease, having\\nmore than one risk factor is especially serious. That’s because risk\\nfactors tend to “gang up” and worsen each other’s effects. For\\nexample, if you have high blood cholesterol and you smoke, your\\nheart disease risk increases enormously. The message is clear: You\\nneed to take heart disease risk seriously, and the best time to reduce\\nthat risk is now.\\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Equally worrisome, blood pressure levels have\\nincreased substantially for American children and teens, which\\nincreases their risk of developing hypertension in adulthood.\\nMajor contributors to high blood pressure are a family history of\\nthe disease, overweight, and dietary salt. Older individuals are at\\nhigher risk than younger people. Among older individuals, women\\nare more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. African\\nAmericans are more likely to develop high blood pressure, and at\\nearlier ages, than Whites. But nearly all of us are at risk, especially\\nas we grow older. Middle-aged Americans who don’t currently \\nhave high blood pressure have a 90-percent chance of eventually\\ndeveloping the disease.\\nHigh blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it \\nusually doesn’t cause symptoms. As a result, many people pay little\\nattention to their blood pressure until they become seriously ill.\\nAccording to a national survey, two-thirds of people with high \\nblood pressure do not have it under control. The good news is that\\nyou can take action to control or prevent high blood pressure, and\\nthereby avoid many life-threatening disorders. A new blood pres-\\nsure category, called prehypertension, has been created to alert peo-\\nple to their increased risk of developing high blood pressure so that\\nthey can take steps to prevent the disease.\\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Everyone has to have some blood pressure,\\nso that blood can get to all of the body’s organs. Usually, blood\\npressure is expressed as two numbers, such as 120/80, and is \\nmeasured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The first number \\nis the systolic blood pressure, the amount of force used when the \\nheart beats. The second number, or diastolic blood pressure, is the\\npressure that exists in the arteries between heartbeats.\\nBecause blood pressure changes often, your health care provider\\nshould check it on several different days before deciding whether it is\\ntoo high. Blood pressure is considered “high” when it stays above\\nprehypertensive levels over a period of time.

But many people don’t realize that the \\nsecond category—prehypertension—also increases your risk of heart\\nattack, stroke, and heart failure. To the extent possible, everyone\\nshould aim for normal blood pressure levels.\\nBe aware, too, that a high systolic blood pressure level (first number)\\nis dangerous. If your systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or high-\\ner, you are more likely to develop cardiovascular and kidney diseases\\neven if your diastolic blood pressure (second number) is in the \\nnormal range. After age 50, people are more likely to develop high\\nsystolic blood pressure. High systolic blood pressure is high blood\\npressure. If you have this condition, you will need to take steps to\\ncontrol it. High blood pressure can be controlled in two ways:  by\\nchanging your lifestyle and by taking medication.\\nChanging Your Lifestyle\\nIf your blood pressure is not too high, you may be able to control \\nit entirely by losing weight if you are overweight, getting regular\\nphysical activity, cutting down on alcohol, and changing your eating\\nhabits. A special eating plan called DASH can help you lower your\\nblood pressure. DASH stands for “Dietary Approaches to Stop\\nHypertension.”  The DASH eating plan emphasizes fruits, vegeta-\\nbles, whole-grain foods, and low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products.\\nIt is rich in magnesium, potassium, and calcium, as well as protein\\nand fiber. It is low in saturated and total fat and cholesterol, and\\nlimits red meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars.\\nIf you follow the DASH eating plan and also consume less sodium,\\nyou are likely to reduce your blood pressure even more. Sodium is a\\nsubstance that affects blood pressure. It is the main ingredient in\\nsalt and is found in many processed foods, such as soups, conven-\\nience meals, some breads and cereals, and salted snacks.\\nFor more on the DASH eating plan and other changes you can make\\nto lower and prevent high blood pressure, see the “Taking Charge”\\nsection of this guidebook (pages 45–82.)\\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

However, your\\nbody makes all the cholesterol it needs. Over a period of years,\\nextra cholesterol and fat circulating in the blood build up in the\\nwalls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup,\\ncalled plaque, makes the arteries narrower and narrower. As a\\nresult, less blood gets to the heart. Blood carries oxygen to the\\nheart; if enough oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart, you\\nmay suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart\\nis completely cut off, the result is a heart attack.\\nCholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins.\\nLDL carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol pack-\\naged in LDL is often called bad cholesterol, because too high a level\\nof LDL in your blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockage\\nin your arteries.\\nAnother type of cholesterol is HDL, also called good cholesterol.\\nThat’s because HDL helps remove cholesterol from the body, \\npreventing it from building up in your arteries.\\n17Major Risk Factors'),\n",

You may be prescribed just one\\ncholesterol-lowering drug, or two in combination. Following are\\nthe most commonly used medicines:\\nStatins. These are the most commonly prescribed drugs for\\npeople who need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Of all avail-\\nable medications, statins lower LDL cholesterol the most, usually\\nby 20 to 60 percent. Side effects are usually mild, although liver\\nand muscle problems occur rarely. If you experience muscle\\naches or weakness, contact your doctor promptly.  \\nBile acid sequestrants.These medications lower LDL cholesterol\\nby about 10 to 20 percent. Bile acid sequestrants are often \\nprescribed along with a statin to further decrease LDL cholesterol \\nlevels. Side effects may include constipation, bloating, nausea, and\\ngas. However, long-term use of these medicines is considered safe. \\nNiacin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, lowers total cholesterol, LDL\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while also raising HDL \\ncholesterol. Niacin is available without a prescription, but it is\\nimportant to use it only under a doctor’s care because of possi-\\nble serious side effects. In some people, it may worsen peptic\\nulcers or cause liver problems, gout, or high blood sugar. \\nFibrates. These drugs can reduce triglycerides levels by 20 to\\n50 percent, while increasing HDL cholesterol by 10 to 15 percent.\\nFibrates are not very effective for lowering LDL cholesterol.

You may want to work with a registered dietitian\\nto help you make these changes. A dietitian can teach you about the\\neating plan that is best for you, determine a reasonable calorie level,\\nand help you choose foods and plan menus. A dietitian can also help\\nyou keep track of your progress and encourage you to stay on your\\neating plan. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get a\\nreferral to a registered dietitian. In the meantime, if you have high\\nblood pressure or high blood cholesterol, here are some guidelines: \\nBlood Pressure and the DASH Eating Plan\\nIf you have high blood pressure or prehypertension, you may want\\nto follow an eating plan called DASH. DASH stands for “Dietary\\nApproaches to Stop Hypertension,” and the eating plan emphasizes\\nfruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, and low-fat milk products.\\nIt is rich in magnesium, potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber, but\\nlow in saturated fat, trans fat, total fat, and cholesterol. It limits \\nred meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars. In many ways,\\nDASH is similar to the TLC eating plan described on pages 53–55.\\nHowever, the DASH plan also encourages you to eat specific foods\\nrich in the nutrients noted above.\\nA major study found that people who followed this eating plan\\nreduced their blood pressure more than those who ate more “typical”\\nAmerican diets, which have fewer fruits and vegetables. A second\\nstudy found that people who followed the DASH eating plan and cut\\ndown on sodium had the biggest reductions in blood pressure. (Salt,\\nor sodium chloride, and other forms of sodium are found in many\\nprocessed foods. Often, more salt is added to food during cooking\\nand at the table.) So, for a truly winning combination, follow the\\nDASH eating plan and lower your sodium intake as much as possible.\\nThe study found that the less sodium people consumed, the more\\ntheir blood pressure dropped. (See ”The DASH Eating Plan” on\\npages 51–52and “Please Don’t Pass the Salt” on page 52.) \\nWhile the DASH eating plan is geared especially toward people with\\nhigh blood pressure or prehypertension, it is a healthy plan for\\neveryone. So share it with your family. When people with normal\\nblood pressure follow the DASH eating plan, especially when they\\nalso consume less sodium, they lessen their chances of developing\\nhigh blood pressure. Remember, 90 percent of middle-aged\\nAmericans go on to develop high blood pressure. Use the DASH\\nplan to help beat the odds! \\nYour Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Examples are \\nno-salt-added canned vegetables or ready-to-eat cereals that \\nhave no added salt or the lowest amount of sodium listed on the\\nNutrition Facts panel on the food label. \\n● When you cook, be “spicy” instead of “salty.” Flavor foods with\\nherbs, spices, wine, lemon, lime, or vinegar. Be creative!\\n● Don’t bring the salt shaker to the table. Try an herb substitute \\ninstead, such as powdered garlic, onion, or thyme. \\n● Use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned, \\nsmoked, or processed types.\\n● Cut down on cured foods (such as bacon and ham), foods \\npacked in brine (such as pickles and olives), and condiments \\n(such as mustard, ketchup, barbeque sauce, and monosodium\\nglutamate). You should even limit lower sodium versions of \\nsoy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  \\n● Read the Nutrition Facts label on the food package and choose\\nconvenience foods that are lower in sodium. These foods \\ninclude frozen dinners, pizza, breads, packaged mixes, canned \\nsoups and broths, and salad dressings.\\n● Rinse canned foods, such as tuna and canned beans, to \\nremove some of the sodium.\\nWhile salt substitutes containing potassium chloride may be useful\\nfor some individuals, they can be harmful to people with certain\\nmedical conditions.

To lose weight, most overweight people will need to\\ncut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their current diet.\\nFor tips on choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods, see “The Substitution\\nSolution” on pages 66–67.\\nKeep milk on the menu. Don’t cut out milk products as you try to\\nreduce calories and fat. Milk and milk products are rich in calcium, \\na nutrient that helps prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.\\nInstead, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products, which\\nhave the same amount of calcium as whole-milk products. Make the\\nswitch gradually. If you are used to drinking whole milk, first cut\\nback to 2 percent, then move to 1 percent, and finally to fat-free milk.\\nKeep moving. Physical activity is key to successful, long-term\\nweight loss. It can help you burn calories, trim extra fat from your\\nwaist, and control your appetite. It can also tone your muscles and\\nincrease aerobic fitness. To lose weight and to prevent further\\nweight gain, gradually build up to at least 60 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the\\nweek. If you’ve lost weight, in order to keep it off, you’ll need to \\ndo even more physical activity—from 60–90 minutes of daily mod-\\nerate-intensity physical activity. But you don’t need to run yourself\\nragged. A recent study showed that moderate physical activity, such\\nas brisk walking, helps people lose weight as effectively as more \\nvigorous exercise. For more tips, see “Get Moving!” on page 72.\\nSteer clear of fast food. A single meal from a fast food restaurant\\nmay contain as many calories as you need for a whole day!

If you are very overweight, or if you are\\noverweight and have other weight-related risk factors or diseases,\\nyour doctor may advise you to take a medicine to help you take off\\npounds. You should use a weight-loss drug only after you have tried\\na low-calorie diet, more moderate-intensity physical activity, and\\nother lifestyle changes for 6 months without successfully losing\\nweight. Because weight-loss medicines have side effects, you should\\nconsider all of the risks and benefits before trying one of them.\\nThese drugs should be used along with a low-calorie eating plan and\\nregular physical activity, not as a substitute for these lifestyle changes.\\nGet support. Tell your family and friends about your weight-loss\\nplans and let them know how they can be most helpful to you.\\nSome people also find it useful to join a structured weight-loss pro-\\ngram. The most effective groups provide support and advice for per-\\nmanently changing eating and physical activity habits. (See “How\\nTo Choose a Weight-Loss Program” on page 70.)\\nLock in your losses. After reaching your weight-loss goal, switch\\nyour efforts to keeping the weight off by continuing to eat a nutri-\\ntious, lower calorie diet and getting regular physical activity. To\\nmaintain your weight, you’ll need to become even more active than\\nbefore:  Aim for 60 to 90 minutes of physical activity per day.\\nWhile this may seem like a tall order, remember that you can count\\nthe activities that you’re already doing. Common daily activities\\nsuch as climbing stairs, pushing a stroller, unloading groceries, gar-\\ndening, and brisk walking all count as physical activity. Just be sure\\nyou do enough of them!\\nSeven Secrets of Weight Management\\nIf you have ever tried to take off weight, you know that it’s more than\\na matter of promising yourself that you’ll eat less and move more.\\nYou also need to mentally prepare yourself for new behaviors.

Some of these medications\\ncontain very small amounts of nicotine, which can help lessen\\nthe urge to smoke. They include nicotine gum (available over-the\\ncounter), the nicotine patch (available over the counter and by\\nprescription), a nicotine inhaler (by prescription only), and a nico-\\ntine nasal spray (by prescription only). Another quitting aid is\\nBupropion SR, a medicine that contains no nicotine but reduces\\nthe craving for cigarettes.

Some people also\\nmay gain weight because they substitute high-calorie foods for\\ncigarettes. Choosing more low-calorie foods and getting more\\nphysical activity can reduce the amount of weight you gain.\\nIf you do put on some weight, you can work on losing it after you\\nhave become comfortable as a nonsmoker.

Most smokers slip three to five times before\\nthey quit for good. To get right back on the nonsmoking track:\\n■ Don’t be discouraged. Having a cigarette doesn’t mean you \\ncan’t quit smoking. A slip happens to many people who \\nsuccessfully quit. Keep thinking of yourself as a nonsmoker.\\n(You are one.)\\n■ Learn from experience. What was the “trigger” that made you \\nlight up? Were you driving home from work, enjoying a glass of \\nwine at a party, feeling angry with your boss? Think back on \\nthe day’s events until you remember what the trigger was.\\n■ Take charge.

Aspirin also can help to keep arteries open\\nin those who have had a heart bypass or other\\nartery-opening procedure, such as angioplasty. In\\naddition, aspirin is given to people who arrive at the hospital\\nwith a suspected heart attack or stroke.\\nIt’s important to know that aspirin has not been approved by the\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of heart\\nattacks in those who have never had a heart attack or stroke. \\nHowever, a recent, large study has found that among healthy\\nwomen, taking low-dose aspirin every other day may help to\\nprevent a first stroke, and among women over the age of 65,\\nmay also help prevent a first heart attack. If you are consider-\\ning taking aspirin for this purpose, keep in mind that it is a\\npowerful drug with many side effects, and can mix dangerous-\\nly with other drugs. Take daily aspirin to prevent heart attack\\nonly with your doctor’s specific advice and guidance. If aspirin\\nis a good choice for you, be sure to take the dose \\nrecommended by your doctor. \\nIf you’re thinking about using aspirin to either prevent or treat\\na heart problem, talk with your doctor first.

We now know that\\ntwo-thirds of teenagers have at least one risk factor for heart dis-\\nease, from overweight and “couch potato-itis” to unhealthy blood\\npressure and cholesterol levels. Even more disturbing, about one\\nmillion U.S. teenagers have metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster\\nof risk factors that greatly increases the risk of a later heart attack.\\nWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to help them develop\\nheart healthy habits—and the earlier the better. Here are some ways\\nto begin:\\nSet a good example. Adults have a big influence on children’s and\\nteens’ behavior—even though kids may not want to admit it. If you\\nfollow a healthy lifestyle, the younger members of your family will be\\nmore likely to do the same. Let them see you eat-\\ning nutritious snacks and enjoying outdoor\\nactivities, and invite them to join in. If you\\nsmoke, stop—and tell your kids and grand-\\nkids why you’re quitting.\\nWhat’s cookin’?Fully 80 percent of\\nchildren eat fewer than five serv-\\nings of fruits and vegetables per\\nday. What to do? Practice\\n“stealth cooking”—creating\\nhealthy meals for kids that will\\nstill make their mouths water. You\\ncan chop veggies into small pieces\\nand add them to favorite recipes,\\nsuch as pizza or spaghetti sauce.\\nIf your kids love tacos, try replacing\\ntaco shells with crunchy lettuce\\nleaves, and pile on some extra\\nchopped tomato.

For dessert, skip the ice\\ncream and offer fresh fruit, fig bars, ginger snaps, graham crackers,\\nor frozen fat-free dairy desserts.\\nRaise “kitchen kids.” Most children enjoy cooking when it’s pre-\\nsented as an easy, fun activity. Show young kids how to clean fruits\\nand veggies and combine them into colorful salads. Let them make\\n“fruit-salad faces” out of sliced apples, bananas, and raisins. When\\nthey’re old enough, teach children to use the stove, oven, microwave,\\nand toaster safely. Show teens how to make simple, healthy dishes,\\nsuch as whole-grain pasta with vegetables and broiled chicken or\\nfish. Encourage them to be creative with herbs and spices. Children\\nwho have basic kitchen skills appreciate food more and are more\\nlikely to try new dishes.\\nGet them moving. The latest “Dietary Guidelines for Americans”\\nrecommend that children and teenagers be physically active for at\\nleast 60 minutes per day. Yet, in a world chock full of video games,\\nTV shows, and computer offerings, few young people are as active\\nas they should be. To encourage children to get off the couch, find\\nout what kinds of physical activities they do enjoy and make it easy\\nfor them to participate. If the kids in your family like to ride bikes,\\nplan a Sunday outing on your local trail. Walk, cycle, or jog with\\nthem to places close by. Use your backyard or local park to toss a\\nFrisbee around or to play a game of basketball, badminton, or vol-\\nleyball. Make an effort to gear activities to children’s ages. Younger\\nkids, up to age 10, tend to have quick bursts of energy sandwiched\\nbetween longer periods of rest, while older children usually have\\nmore endurance.
